# ðŸ“Š Financial + SEC Dashboard

## Friendly Neighbourhood Finance Guy

**Financial + SEC Dashboard** is a **professional portfolio project** combining **real-time market data, SEC filings, and AI-powered insights**. Users can query companies in natural language and generate **intuitive financial reports**.

The app is **deployable on Hugging Face Spaces** and demonstrates skills in **data engineering, NLP, AI pipelines, and financial analytics**.

---

* Real-time **company data** from Finnhub (profile, quotes, metrics)
* Access recent **SEC filings** (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.)
* **AI-powered insights** via Hugging Face LLM + embeddings
* **Financial analytics**: ratios, benchmarks, and peer comparisons
* **Downloadable PDF/HTML reports**
* Professional **UI** with metrics cards and charts

---

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works

1. User selects a company ticker or enters a custom one.
2. Data is fetched from **Finnhub API** and **SEC EDGAR**.

4. User questions are answered using a **Hugging Face LLM**.
5. **Analytics layer** computes financial ratios, comparisons, and insights.
6. Results displayed in **cards and charts**, with optional **PDF download**.
